## GDP Forecasting Research Database

A relational database of academic research focused on GDP forecasting and the use of data science techniques in this domain. This repository includes a comprehensive Excel table (named "Database.xlsx") with embedded hyperlinks to published research papers, a bubble graphic illustrating the overlap between traditional econometric methods and data science methods, and relevant definitions and acronym references.

## Introduction

In the field of economic forecasting, the integration of data science techniques has become increasingly important. This repository aims to compile and categorize academic research papers related to GDP forecasting and how data science methods are utilized in this context.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Excel Table**: A structured Excel spreadsheet that contains details about relevant research papers, data science techniques, software, variables used for GDP forecasting, and hyperlinks to source material.

2. **Bubble Graphic**: A visualization illustrating the overlap between traditional econometric methods and data science methods, with hyperlinks to definitions and acronym references.

## Table Structure

The Excel table is structured with the following columns:

- Title of the Research
- Source (Journal, Conference, etc.)
- Embedded Hyperlink to the Full Text
- Data Science Techniques Used
- Data Science Software Used
- Variables Used for GDP Forecast
- Embedded Hyperlink to Source Material
- Relevant Countries
- Hyperlink to Bubble Definitions and Technique Acronym Definitions

## Bubble Graphic

The bubble graphic provides a visual representation of the intersection between traditional econometric methods and data science methods. It includes links to definitions and acronym explanations.

## Data Sources

The research papers and articles in this database have been compiled from academic literature sources, including paywalled content. Proper attribution and citations are included in the Excel table.

## Usage

To use this database:

1. Access the Excel table to explore the academic research and its details.
2. Navigate the bubble graphic to understand the overlap between econometric and data science methods.
3. Use hyperlinks to access the full text of research papers and relevant definitions.
